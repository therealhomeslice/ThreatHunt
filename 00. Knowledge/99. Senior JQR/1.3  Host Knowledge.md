The following command will interrogate all the users of the muggle domain and allow you to look oddities with excel.

Invoke-Command -ComputerName 131.9.2.3 -Credential $creds -ScriptBlock {get-aduser -filter * -property *} | ConvertTo-Csv | out-file muggle_users.csv

While examining the output you can see many users that have non-stig policy and the jake.potts account that was created with oddities
```
(U) Interpret and configure host-based firewalls and Host Intrusion Prevention Systems through group policy.

(U) Explain how to ensure patches are up to date for all domain workstations and determine effectiveness of current process for updating.
```
1. Run Nessus

2. Establish a baseline inventory of all production systems.

3. Prioritize patches based on their criticality either for security or functional reasons.

4. Automate the patch management process to decrease the time between the release and application of patches.

5. Validate that patches work as expected and don’t break any of your systems or applications.

Get-ADComputer -Filter {(Enabled -eq $True)} -Property * | Select-Object Name,OperatingSystem,OperatingSystemVersion

```
(U) Given a list of IOCs identify key log entries/Event IDs ,use a Security information and event management (SIEM) platform to correlate indicators of compromise, and develop dashboards to better visualize data.

(U) Using a SIEM create alerts to detect the creation of unauthorized accounts.

searches for the creation of accounts that are not authorized:

{

  "query": {

    "bool": {

      "must_not": [

        {

          "term": {

            "authorized": true

          }

        }

      ]

    }

  }

}

This query will return all documents where the field authorized is not set to true. You can then set up an alert based on this query and configure the exact trigger conditions.

In Elastic:

1. Click on hamburger on the top left corner

2. navigate to the “Security” section  and click on “detections”

3.
